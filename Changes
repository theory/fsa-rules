Revision history for Perl extension FSA::Rules.

0.25  2006-07-14T18:49:53
      - Reverted "circular reference" change from previous release. It wasn't
        a circular reference after all.
      - Added a "description" attribute for rules.
      - Updated the graph output to output the description of each rule within
        the node, along with the node name.
      - Fixed the "obscure bug" with the 'wrap_nodes' parameter to the graph()
        method so that it no longer breaks graphs.
      - Changed graph tests to use as_canon() instead of as_text(), since
        the latter seems to vary with release of GraphViz.
      - Add the 'with_state_name' parameter to graph() to prepend the state
        name to the label for each node if there is a label. Otherwise the
        label is just the state name regardless of this parameters.
      - Changed the 'wrap_nodes' parameter to graph() to 'wrap_node_labels'.
        The former is still supported but will be removed in a future release.
      - Changed the 'wrap_labels' parameter to graph() to 'wrap_edge_labels'.
        The former is still supported but will be removed in a future release.
      - Changed the 'text_wrap' parameter to graph() to 'wrap_length'. The
        former is still supported but will be removed in a future release.
      - Added the 'node_params' and 'edge_params' parameters to graph() to
        allow greater control over how graphs are output.
      - Edges labels no longer use lines to link them to their edges. This
        behavior can now be handled using 'edge_params => { decorate => 1 }.
      - Removed requirement for the Clone module. This also cuts the memory
        footprint for each rules object roughly in half, since it no longer
        keeps a clone of the arguments to new().

0.24  2006-03-03T00:06:23
      - Added newline to the 'game_over' state in the synopsis. Reported
        by Chris Dolan.
      - FSA::Rules is now serializable via Storable. Suggested by Aaron
        Dalton.
      - Eliminated a circular reference that could lead to memory leaks.

0.23  2006-02-07T05:18:26
      - Fixed some typos.
      - Added DESTROY() methods to prevent memory leaks.

0.22  2005-08-08T17:10:00
      - Calling reset() now resets the "done" flag to undef unless "done"
        is set to a code reference. Reported by Xavier Caron.

0.21  2004-12-31T18:30:20
      - Calling reset() now empties the machine hashref and state hashrefs.
        [Curtis & David]
      - User can now turn text wrapping off and on for nodes and labels.
        [Curtis]
      - states() will now croak if called with any non-existent states.
        [Curtis]
      - Added "decorate => 1" attribute to graphs to have lines drawn from
        the edge to its corresponding label. [Curtis]
      - Changed "label_wrap" to "text_wrap" and had it apply to all text.
        [Curtis].
      - Added "Text::Wrap" as a requirement. [Curtis]
      - Fixed documentation typo--rule actions specified via a hash reference
        rule spec are keyed off the word "action", not "actions". [David]
      - Actions specified via a hash reference rule specification can now
        take a code reference as well as an array referencde of code
        references. [David]

0.20  2004-12-24T18:38:57
      - Modified Synopsis to show off the result() method.
      - Other minor documentation fixes spotted by Curtis Poe.
      - Added graph support. [Curtis Poe]
      - Added at() method. [Curtis Poe]
      - Simplified synopsis. [Curtis Poe]
      - Added "state_class" parameter to simplify subclassing FSA::State.
      - A rule defined as a false scalar value, rather than a code reference,
        now works properly.
      - A successful attempt to switch states with the "strict" attribute
        enabled now succeeds if no other rules evaluate to true.
      - Each rule may now take an optional hash reference instead of a code
        or array reference. The hash reference may optionally specify a
        rule label, which eases the tracking of rules and allows graphs to
        generate rule labels. [Curtis Poe]
      - Changed the state() method to curr_state(). The old name has been
        deprecated, will issue a warnning when called, and will be removed in
        a future version.

0.10  2004-12-17T23:29:54
      - Moved state-specific methods to new FSA::State class. This is a
        pretty significant change and can introduce backwards compatibility
        issues, so the version has been bumped up to 0.10.
      - FSA::State objects are now passed to state actions, rather than the
        FSA::Rules object. Call their machine() method to get the FSA::Rules
        object.
      - Switch actions are now passed two arguments: The current FSA::State
        object and the FSA::State object for the new state.
      - Added notes() method for storing arbitrary notes in the FSA::Rules
        object.
      - Added states() method to return one or more of the state objects in
        a machine.
      - Moved the "message" and "result" methods to the state class. The
        "set_" forms are gone now, since you don't need to specify a state
        when you have a state. Added last_message() and last_result()
        methods to FSA::Rules to get the most recent messages and results
        from the states.
      - Added convenience methods prev_state(), notes(), and done() to the
        state class to reach back into the FSA::Rules object.
      - The start() method will now throw an exception if the machine is
        already running. Call reset() before calling start on a running
        machine.
      - Added "strict" attribute to prevent rules from short-circuiting
        and cause an exception to be thrown if more than one rule returns
        a true value during a call to try_switch(). Suggested by Curtis
        Poe.
      - Added optional parameter hash reference as first argument to new().
        It can force the machine to be started before being returned, or
        can set the "done" or "strict" attributes.

0.07  2004-12-16T22:23:43
      - Updated the synopsis to no longer document non-existent methods.
      - Added notes about DFA vs. NFA state engines and how FSA::Rules
        compares to the two models.
      - Added state methods to allow easy caching and retrieval of state
        results and messages. Also added stack trace methods for easy
        debugging. Implementation by Curtis Poe.

0.06  2004-12-16T02:05:01
      - Added a stack() method to return an arrayref of state transformations.
        Implementation by Curtis Poe.
      - Added reset() which resets the state machine to a pristine state.
        Implementation by Curtis Poe.

0.05  2004-12-16T00:50:49
      - Changed C<try_switch()> to pass any arguments to each rule checking
        code reference. These can be used as inputs in a classic DFA-style
        rule table. Suggested by Paul Hoffman.

0.04  2004-12-16T00:19:41
      - Changed done() to evaluate a code reference if a code reference is
        what is passed to it. Suggested by Curtis Poe.

0.03  2004-12-15T23:45:39
      - Fixed POD for search.cpan.org.

0.02  2004-12-15T22:01:58
      - Changed name to FSA::Rules. Thanks to the module-authors list for the
        feedback!
      - Changed the "enter" and "leave" parameters to "on_enter" and
        "on_exit", respectively. Suggested by Tim Bunce.
      - Changed the check() method to switch() and modified it to return
        the name of the state to which it switched.
      - Added try_switch(), which returns the name of the state to which
        it switched on success, and "undef" on failure.
      - Changed the start() method to return the name of the start state.
      - Added support for numbered states, including "0". Reported by
        Curtis Poe.
      - Changed the "goto" parameter to "rules" to better reflect their
        role and for parity with the new module name.
      - Added the "done" attribute and run() method. Suggested by Curtis
        Poe.
      - Added a check for duplicate state names in new(). Suggested by
        Curtis Poe.

0.01  2004-12-15T07:12:22
      - Initial public release (to module-authors@perl.org only).
